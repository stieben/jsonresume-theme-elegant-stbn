### Testing JSON changes

You can test your changes by updating the `resume.json` file inside the `node_modules/resume-schema/` folder.
You might want to rerun `grunt exec:run_server` whenever you make any changes to `resume.json`.

### Updating styles

All the Less files are organized under the folder `assets/less/`.
Please go through the comments inside `theme.less` to find out into which file to put your Less changes.
Grunt compiles `assets/less/theme.less` to `assets/css/theme.css` which is used eventually in the theme.

**Please do not make any changes inside of `assets/css/theme.css`** â€“ they will be overridden.

### Updating JavaScript

All the JavaScript changes go into `index.js` which is responsible for rendering the theme.
